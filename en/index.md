## 👋 Welcome to my website!

Here you'll find practical tips, examples, and projects in programming and system configuration. I focus on technologies I use every day:

- 🧠 **SQL** – from queries to database optimization  
- 🌐 **RouterOS for MikroTik** – network configuration, scripts, and automation  
- 💻 **C#** – desktop applications, tools, and integrations  
- 🔌 **ESP32 and Arduino** – IoT projects, electronics, and microcontrollers  

This site was created out of a passion for solving problems and sharing knowledge.  
If you're interested in programming, computer networks, or electronics – you're in the right place.
