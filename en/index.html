<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
<p>Here you'll find practical tips, examples, and projects in programming and system configuration. I focus on technologies I use every day:</p>
<ul>
  <li>🧠 <strong>SQL</strong> – from queries to database optimization</li>
  <li>🌐 <strong>RouterOS for MikroTik</strong> – network configuration, scripts, and automation</li>
  <li>💻 <strong>C#</strong> – desktop applications, tools, and integrations</li>
  <li>🔌 <strong>ESP32 and Arduino</strong> – IoT projects, electronics, and microcontrollers</li>
</ul>
<p>This site was created out of a passion for solving problems and sharing knowledge. If you're interested in programming, computer networks, or electronics – you're in the right place.</p>
