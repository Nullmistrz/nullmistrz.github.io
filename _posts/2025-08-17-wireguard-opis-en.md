## 4. Example WireGuard Configuration on Linux 🐧

### Server configuration

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <server_private_key>
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820

# Add clients as Peer
[Peer]
PublicKey = <client1_public_key>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = <client2_public_key>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.3/32
```

### Client configuration

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <client_private_key>
Address = 10.0.0.2/24
ListenPort = 21841

[Peer]
PublicKey = <server_public_key>
Endpoint = <server_IP_address>:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
```

> The values `<server_private_key>`, `<client_private_key>`, `<server_public_key>`, `<client1_public_key>`, etc. are generated with:
> `wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey`
