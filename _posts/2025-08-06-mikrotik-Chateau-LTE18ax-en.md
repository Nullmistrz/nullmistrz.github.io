The MikroTik Chateau LTE18 ax is a home LTE router that I use every day. This is not a sponsored post or advertisement â€“ I simply share my own experiences and practical scripts that may be useful to other users of this model. On this site, I will publish solutions that I personally use in my daily work with this device.

ðŸ‘‰ Also check out the [Projects/MikroTik](/pl/projects/) section, where you will find more practical scripts and solutions for this router.
